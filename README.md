# Brick Breaker Game project
This game is presented as a project for Java course.
The main goal of this project is to practice working on GUI development
so I worked on previously done codes by other programmers, then I tried to customize it and add slight changes

## The game
It is a simple game where the player must smash the bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle.

## How To Play?
- Controls:
  - Pressing the Left and Right arrows moves the paddle
- Allowed attempts:
  - You just have 3 tries to finish the game, if you can't win on one of these 3, you will not be able to play again.

- Wining
  - You simply win if you smach all bricks within the 3 tries, and you will be be able to play again (: (vedio is sped up)
